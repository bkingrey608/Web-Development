    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to my first webpage! This website serves as my individual project
      submission to a Web Development course I’m taking at Kennesaw State
      University. Three milestones must be met over the next several weeks, so
      this is a work in progress. I’ll be continuously updating the site during
      that time and will be experimenting with new concepts I learn along the
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the top of each page, there are links to Home (this page), About, and
      Contact. The Home page serves as an introduction, and I will also add
      notes here whenever I make any significant changes. The About page
      includes personal information about myself and provides some background on
      my skills and goals. The Contact page includes my contact info, along with
      a contact form to submit if you’d like to send me a message.
    </p>
    <p>Thank you for visiting my page, and I welcome any feedback. Enjoy!</p>
