    <h2>The Early Years</h2>
    <p>
      I was born June 8, 1971, in Columbus, GA, to middle-class parents who
      worked hard to provide myself and my younger brother Jarrod the best a kid
      could ever need. My dad was a Civil Engineer who traveled weekly for
      Southern Railroad. We were heavily into sports, and my parents and
      extended family were always there to support us. My mother and her sister
      both worked in Civil Service at Ft. Benning. My grandfather retired as a
      US Army Sgt and finished his working career in Civil Service at Ft.
      Benning as well. My other grandfather was a decorated police officer who
      served for over 35 years as a Lieutenant for the Columbus Police Dept.
      Many ask if I am a “military brat,” and my answer is always “no.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      As a student, I excelled from Elementary school through High School as a
      member of the National Honor Society. I played baseball and football for
      Columbus High School, and even though I received scholarship offers to
      play baseball in college, I knew I’d never make a career in the sport. As
      an engineer, my dad played a big part in my choice of Georgia Tech to
      pursue an engineering degree. My college years were very difficult.
      Studying Mechanical Engineering, working part-time, and competing
      nationally in Racquetball consumed all my time.

    <h2>Career</h2>
    <p>
      After six years of college, I got a break. I got a job as a Field Service
      Engineer for a German-based Electronics/Software company. I spent nine
      years traveling the country full-time installing Printing Presses. I had
      no background in electronics, other than a car stereo hobby, and learned
      all my skills on the job. I’d say it took about two years to become an
      expert on the Hardware side – Power Distribution, Relay logic, VFDs,
      Pneumatics, etc. During that time, I married and had two children, Jacob
      and Hudson. They are now 23 and 17 years old, respectively! For the last
      15 years I’ve focused mostly on the Software side – PLCs, HMIs, SCADA,
      etc. and I no longer must travel full-time. I work as a Controls Support
      Engineer for Vanderlande, a Netherlands-based company that is an OEM for
      sorting equipment for numerous international customers such as airports,
      warehouses, Amazon, and Walmart.
    </p>
    <h2>Return to School</h2>
    <p>
      Not long after I began working at Vanderlande, I saw a shift in the
      industry away from Low-Level controls (PLCs), and toward High-Level
      controls (PC-Based). I found myself having to reach out to software
      engineers far too often and decided to do something about that.
      Personally, I remarried and my wife, Crystal helped motivate me to return
      to school. I’m now pursuing a bachelor’s degree in IT at Kennesaw State
      University to learn new skills that will benefit my career. After two
      years at KSU now, much of what I’m studying I’m very familiar with due to
      my experience. I thoroughly enjoyed the two Java classes I’ve taken and
      currently I’m studying Web Development which is completely new to me. It’s
      already making a difference in my career. I’m much more comfortable and
      skilled at studying code written in high-level languages and look forward
      to learning more.
